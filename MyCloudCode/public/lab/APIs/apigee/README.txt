Welcome to the Apigee App Services template app for HTML5/JavaScript!

App Services is Apigee’s hosted version of the open-source technology “Usergrid” — you may find references to that name in a few places. 

You will need to make a few edits for this template to work. Open index.html in a text editor (Notepad, TextMate, SublimeText, or your preferred IDE) and follow the instructions inside.

If you followed the steps correctly, you should see a visual confirmation when you open index.html in a browser!
